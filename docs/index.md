# Three parts

### 1.  Highlevel
[Highlevel](Highlevel/index.md), somewhat abstract that is understandable and is an introdction to start reading the detailed sections. 

### 2. Detailed
[Detailed](Detailed/index.md), for the invested reader seeking deeper understanding. If the detail is not detailed enough move to the beyond funny sections.

### 3. Beyond funny
[Beyond funny](Beyond%20%funny/index.md), for some *this* is the funny part. If that is not funny then you better try out the highlevel sections first.
