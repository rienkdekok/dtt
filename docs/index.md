# Three parts

### 1.  Highlevel
[Highlevel](Highlevel/index.md), somewhat abstract that is understandable and is an introdction to start reading the detailed sections. 

### 2. Detailed
More detail for the invested reader seeking deeper understanding. If the detail is not detailed enough move to the beyond funny sections. - [Detailed](Detailed/index.md)

### 3. Beyond funny
For some this is the funny part. If you donâ€™t better try out the highlevel section first. - [Beyond funny](Beyond%20%funny/index.md)
